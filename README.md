# Hidden Markov Model Using Viterbi Algorithm
My Implementation of the Hidden Markov Model using Viterbi Algorithm from scratch


````
hmmlearn.py: takes a training text file as input(tagged sentences in the form <token>/<tag>) as input and creates the vocabulary, emission and transition matrices and stores them in a text file called hmmmodel.txt


hmmdecode.py: takes a text file of sentences that are to be tagged and stores the output in hmmoutput.txt with sentences in the form <text>/<tag>
