            "For the use of a Registered Medical Practitioner or a Hospital or a Laboratory only. Prescribing Information Inandronic Acid Tablets Idrofos 150 Dosage form: Tablets Composition: Each Film Coated Tablet Contains: lbandronic Acid Monosodium Monohydrate equivalentto Ibandronic Acid 150 mg Excipients on Clinical Pharmacology: lbandronic acid is anitrogen containing bisphosphonate that inhibits osteoclast mediated bone resorption. Mechanism of Action The action of ibandronic acid on bone tissue Is based on its affinity for hydroxyapatite, which is part of the mineral matrix of bone. Ibandronic acid inhibits osteoclast activity and reduces bone resorption and turnover. In post menopausal women, it reduces the elevated rate of bone turnover, leading to, on average, a net gain in bone mass. Pharmacokinetics The absorption of oral ibandronic acid occurs in the upper gastrointestinal tract. Plasma concentrations increase ina dose linear manner up to 50 mg oral intake and increases nonlinearly above this dose. Following oral dosing, the time to maximum observed plasma ibandronic acid concentrations ranged from 0.5 to 2 hours (median 1 hour) in fasted healthy postmenopausal women. The oral bioavailability of ibandronic acid is reduced by about 90% when it is administered concomitantly with a standard breakfast in comparison with bioavailability observed in fasted subjects. There is no meaningful reduction in bioavailability when ibandronic acid is taken at least 60 minutes before a meal. However, voth bioavailability and the effect on bone mineral density (BMD) are reduced when food or beverages are taken less than 60 minutes following an ibandronic acid dose. After absorption, ibandronic acid either rapidly binds to bone or is excreted into urine. In humans, the apparent terminal volume of distribution is at least 90 L, and the amount of dose removed from the circulation via the bone is estimated to be 40% to 50% of the circulating dose. In vitro protein binding in human serum was 99.5% +o 90.9% over an ibandronic acid concentration range of 2 to 10 ng/ml in one study and approximately 85.7% over a concentration range of 0.5 to 10 ng/ml in another study. There is no evidence that ibandronic acid is metabolised in humans. The portion of ibandronic acid that is not removed from the circulation via bone absorption is eliminated unchanged by the kidney (approximately 50% +o 60% of the absorbed dose). Unabsorbed ibandronic acid is eliminated unchanged in the feces. The plasma elimination of ibandronic acid is multiphasic. Its renal clearance and distribution into bone accounts for a rapid and early decline in plasma concentrations, reaching 10% of the Cmax within 3 or § hours after intravenous or oral administration, respectively. This is followed by a slower clearance phase as ‘bandronic acid redistributes back into the blood from bone. The observed apparent terminal half-life for ibandronic acid is generally dependent on the dose studied and on assay sensitivity. The observed apparent terminal half-life for the 150 mg ibandronic acid tablet upon oral administration to healthy postmenopausal women ranges from 37 to 157 hours. Total clearance of ibandronic acid is low, with average values in the range 84 to 160 ml/min. Renal clearance (about 60 ml/min in healthy postmenopausal females) accounts for 50% to 60% of total clearance and Is related to creatinine clearance. The difference between the apparent total and renal clearances likely reflects bone uptake of the drug. The pharmacokinetics of ibandronic acid has not been studied in patients < 18 years of age. Since ibandronic acid is not known to be metabolised, the only difference in ibandronic acid elimination for geriatric patients versus younger patients is expected to relate to progressive age related changes in renal function. Renal clearance of ibandronic acid in patients with various degrees of renal impairment is linearly related to creatinine clearance (Clcr). Following a single dose of 0.5 mg ibandronic acid by intravenous administration, patients with CLcr 40 to 70 ml/min had 55% higher exposure (AUC ..) than the exposure observed in subjects with CLer > 90 ml/min. Patients with CLer < 30 ml/min had more than a two fold increase in exposure compared to the exposure for healthy subjects. No studies have been performed to assess the oharmacokinetics of ibandronic acid in patients with hepatic impairment since ibandronic acid is not metabolised in the human liver. Indications: Idrofos® 150 is indicated for the treatment and prevention of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. Contra-indications: e Knownhypersensitivity to ibandronic acid or to any of its excipients. e Uncorrected hypocalcemia. e _|nability to stand or sit upright for at least 60 minutes. lAlarninase and Precautions: = . Hypocalcemia and other disturbances of bone and mineral metabolism should be effectively treated before starting ibandronic acid therapy. Adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D is importantin all patients. Osteonecrosis, primarily in the jaw, has been reported in patients treated with bisphosphonates. Most cases have been in cancer patients undergoing dental procedures, but some have occurred in patients with postmenopausal osteoporosis or other diagnoses. Known risk factors for osteonecrosis include a diagnosis of cancer, concomitant therapies (e.g., chemotherapy, radiotherapy, corticosteroids), and co-morbid disorders (e.g., anemia, coagulopathy, infection, pre-existing dental disease). Most reported cases have been in patients treated with bisphosphonates intravenously but some have been in patients treated orally. For patients who develop osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) while on bisphosphonate therapy, dental surgery may exacerbate the condition. In postmarketing experience, severe and occasionally incapacitating bone, joint, and/or muscle pain has been reported in patients taking bisphosphonates that are approved for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis. However, such reports have been infrequent. This category of drugs include ibandronic acid tablets. Most of the patients were postmenopausal women. The time to onset of symptoms varied from one day to several months after starting the drug. Most patients had relief of symptoms after stopping. A subset had recurrence of symptoms when rechallenged with the same drug or another bisphosphonate. Bisphosphonates are known to interfere with the use of bone imaging agents. Specific studies with ibandronic acid have not been performed. Physicians should be alert to signs or symptoms signaling a possible esophageal reaction during therapy, and patients should be instructed to discontinue ibandronic acid and seek medical attention if they develop symptoms of esophageal irritation such as new or worsening dysphagia, pain on swallowing, retrosternal pain, or heartburn. Ibandronic acid is not recommended for patients with a creatinine clearance below 30 ml/min. Pregnancy & Lactation There are no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women. lbandronic acid should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the mother and fetus. tis not known whether ibandronic acid is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when ibandronic acidis administered to a nursing woman. Drug Interactions: A pharmacokinetic interaction study in healthy volunteers demonstrated that 75 mg ranitidine (25 mg injected intravenously 90 and 15 minutes before and 30 minutes after ibandronic acid administration) increased the oral bioavailability of 10 mg ibandronic acid by about 20%. This degree of increase is not considered to be clinically relevant. Pharmacokinetic interaction studies in postmenopausal women have demonstrated the absence of any interaction potential with tamoxifen or hormone replacement therapy (estrogen). No interaction was observed when coadministered with melphalan/prednisolone in patients with multiple myeloma. Products containing calcium and other multivalent cations (such as aluminium, magnesium, iron), including milk, are likely to interfere with absorption of thandronic acid. Ibandronic acid should be taken at least 60 minutes before any oral medications containing multivalent cations (including antacids, supplements 01 vitamins). Patients should fast overnight (at least 6 hours) before taking ibandronic acid and continue fasting for 1 hour following intake of ibandronic acid. Since aspirin, NSAIDs, and bisphosphonates are all associated with gastrointestinal irritation, caution should be exercised in the concomitant use of aspirin or NSAIDs with ibandronic acid. Side effects: The most commonly reported adverse effects are back pain, pain in extremity, infection, asthenia, allergic reaction, dyspepsia, diarrhea, tooth disorder, vomiting, gastritis, hypercholesteralemia, myalgia, joint disorder, arthritis, headache, hypertension, dizziness, vertigo, nerve root lesion, muscle cramp, upper respiratory infection, bronchitis, pneumonia, pharyngitis, urinary tract infection, nausea, constipation, abdominal pain, arthralgia, localised osteoarthritis, influenza, nasopharyngitis, influenza like illness, rash, insomnia, fatigue, flatulence, gastroesophageal reflux disease, musculoskeletal pain, fever, chills, loss of appetite, bone pain. Reports in the medical literature indicate that bisphosphonates may be associated with ocular inflammation such as uveitis and scleritis. In some cases, these events did not resolve until the bisphosphonate was discontinued. Two patients who received ibandronic acid monthly experienced ocular inflammation, one was a case of uveitis and the other scleritis. Overdosage: No specific information is available on the treatment of overdosage with Idrofos” 150. However, based on knowledge of this class of compounds, oral overdosage may result in hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia and upper gastrointestinal adverse events, such as upsel stomach, dyspepsia, esophagitis, gastritis, or ulcer. Milk or antacids should be given to bind ibandronic acid. Due to the risk of esophageal irritation, vomiting should not be induced, and the patient should remain fully upright. Dialysis would not be beneficial. Dosage and Administration: The recommended dose is one ldrofos® 150 tablettaken once monthly onthe same date each month. To maximize absorption and clinical benefit, Idrofos” 150 should be taken after an overnight fast (atleast 6 hours) and at least 60 minutes before the first food or drink (other than water) of the day or before taking any oral medication or supplementation, including calcium, antacids, or vitamins. can nl levtbadiann Ieluntan” {RM tnhlate Plain water is the only drink that should be taken with Idrofos® 150. It should be noted that some mineral waters may have a higher concentration of calcium and therefore should not be used. Patients should not chew or suck the tablet because of a potential oropharyngeal ulceration. The Idrofos® 150 tablet should be taken on the same date each month. ifthe once monthly dose is missed, and the patient's next scheduled Idrofos® 150 day is more than 7 days away, the patient should be instructed to take one Idrofos” 150 tablet in the morning following the date that it is remembered. The patient should then return to taking one Idrofes® 150 tablet every month in the morning of their chosen day, according to their original schedule. The patient must not take two 150 mg tablets within the same week. If the patient's next scheduled Idrofos® 150 day is only 1 to 7 days away, the patient must wait until their next scheduled Idrofos” 150 day to take their tablet. The patient should then return to taking one Idrofos” 150 every month in the morning of their chosen day, according to their original schedule. Patients should receive supplemental calcium or vitamin D if dietary intake is inadequate. Elderly. No dosage adjustmentis necessary in elderly.
